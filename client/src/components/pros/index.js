          Before you begin working with us, we want to introduce ourselves! I am
          Natalia Coleho(Left), I'm 24 years old and was raised in Rio de
          Janeiro, Brazil. I currently reside in Orlando Florida, and am
          currently working on my masters Degree at the University of Central
          Florida, along with this I also have my Bachelors Degree from UCF in
          Sports and Exercise Science. I started training at the age of 15, and
          have been completely obsessed since! I turned Pro at the age of 19,
          the youngest age ever, and since then have accumulated 12 first place
          victories. The most notible of these being 2 Arnold Classic victories.
          Along with this, i have also participated in 5 Olympia competitions! I
          am excited to bring the same dedication that allowed me 2 Arnold
          classic victories to you and your physique! And I am Ferlan
          Bailey(Right)! Im originally from the Island of Grenada, but since the
          age of 13 I have been living in the Orlando Area! Before becoming an
          IFBB Pro, i worked as a Firefighter in Eustis, however now my time is
          fully devoted to Coaching, being home with family, and running my
          supplement brand. I turned pro in 2016 and have competed in numerous
          shows since then. Although i dont have plans of competing anytime
          soon, my love for bodybuilding is still a huge part of my life thanks
          to coaching.
